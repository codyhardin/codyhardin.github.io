Iâ€™m a recent cybersecurity graduate looking to pivot to the field of Cybersecurity from the IT side of things. I currently work on-site on a help desk supporting 75+ users in an unclassified DoD environment consisting primarily of Windows infrastructure. My responsibilities include desktop support, printer troubleshooting, and basic network support. 

I'm working on building out [my homelab](/homelab) as a place to poke, prod, and otherwise tinker with technologies, tools, and whatever else interests me.

### Purpose
This blog is really an excuse for me to talk through and spend time exploring IT and/or Cybersecurity concepts that I find interesting or flat-out don't understand yet. From a past life as a Strength and Conditioning coach, I spend a lot of time creating content for our members and my athletes. I enjoyed that process of planning, writing, and revising those messages and training sessions. That process really helped me to better understand what I was teaching them and I hope this blogs serves much the same purpose, albeit in a differetn domain.
