### Who am I
Iâ€™m a recent cybersecurity graduate looking to pivot to the Cybersecurity field from IT and a past life as a Strength Coach and Personal Trainer. 

I have 1.5 years working as part of a helpdesk supporting a Windows environment and 200+ users across a hybrid workspace. My responsibilities include local IT/AV/printer troubleshooting, user account management, and basic network support in a DoD environment.

My current projects include studying for and passing the CompTIA CySA+ and Pentest+ exams as well as finishing [my homelab](/homelab) as a place to build, study, and experiment with tools and technology I come across on the job or through my studies.

### Purpose
This blog is really an excuse for me to talk through and spend time exploring IT and/or Cybersecurity concepts that I find interesting or flat-out don't understand yet. 

From a past life as a Strength and Conditioning coach, I spend a lot of time creating content for our members and my athletes. I enjoyed that process of planning, writing, and revising those messages and training sessions. That process really helped me to better understand what I was teaching them and I hope this blogs serves much the same purpose, albeit in a differetn domain.
