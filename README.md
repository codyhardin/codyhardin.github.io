I’m a recent cybersecurity graduate looking to transition to the field of Cybersecurity following a career change from the health and fitness realm. I currently work on-site on a help desk supporting 150+ users in an unclassified DoD environment consisting primarily of Windows infrasturcure. My responsibilities include desktop support, printer troubleshooting, and basic network support. 

Outside of work, I spend time working through CTFs on sites such as tryhackme.com and test concepts in [my homelab](/homelab) when I come across something new or novel I want to dive deeper into.

### Purpose
This blog serves primarily as a sounding board for anything I've come across in my studies or on the job that I need to spend more time working through. 

Having only been within this space for about a year and a half at the time of writing, blogs have been hugely beneficial to me as a way to digest and learn from other people’s mishaps, mistakes, and processes.

I've learned through a past career as a coach, that one of the best ways to test how well you know something is by explaining it to someone else. I just might be rambling to a computer but it's a start.
