I am a help desk tech supporting 200+ users in an unclassified DoD environment consisting primarily of Windows infrasturcure. My responsibilities include desktop support, printer troubleshooting, and basic network support. 

Outside of work, I spend time working through CTFs on sites such as tryhackme.com and test concepts in [my homelab](/homelab) when I come across something new or novel I want to dive deeper into.

### Purpose
This blog serves primarily as a sounding board for anything I've come across in my studies or on the job that I need to spend more time working through. I've learned through a past career as a coach, that one of the best ways to test how well you know something is by explaining it to someone else. I just might be rambling to a computer but it's a start.
