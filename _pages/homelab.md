## How It Started
Early on in my current position, I was fortunate enough to hit if off with one of our sys admins who was very adamant on the powers of a blog and homelab. As I was still taking classes at the time, he suggested a homelab as a way of diving into any tools ot technologies that I wanted to poke around in more than what was offered in class labs/textbooks.

Our talks naturally started on Raspberry Pi projects like smart displays or a simple network sensor using Zeek but given how expensive Pi boards are currently, I've' shifted a lot of my focus to VMs. It just so happens that pandemic me had the foresight to build out a gaming pc that is incredibly overspecced... Who am I to turn down Black Friday deals when they come up? With that computer, I'm able to handle 4-5 reasonable VMs depending on scale

## Goals
My current focus is building out an environment that's scalable gives me the ability to easily see both the offensive and defensive perspective during scenarios.

Up until this point, I've been using Kali and Metasploitable2 but am in the process of finishing the first iteration of what I'm sure will be an ever-evolving lab:
1. Kali Linux attack machine
2. PfSense Router/Firewall
3. Windows 10/11 Workstation
4. Windows Server 2019 as AD
5. Linux Server
6. SecurityOnion as analyst machine

### Layout
Once everything is functional, I'll be putting a network map here as a reference for future posts involving the lab.
