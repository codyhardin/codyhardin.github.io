## Why A Homelab
Early on in my current position, I was fortunate enough to connect with one of our sys admins who was very adamant on the powers of a blog and homelab. As I was still taking classes at the time, he suggested a homelab as a way of diving into any tools, and systems that piqued my interest in class.
While our talks started with the infamous Raspberry Pi projects like a smart display and Pi-Hole, they nonetheless inspired me to find and build a homelab structure that would fit my more cybersecurity-centered interests as well as anything IT related that I think is interesting, useful, or just plain cool to tinker with.
