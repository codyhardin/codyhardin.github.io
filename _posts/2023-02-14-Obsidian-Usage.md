title: "Obsidian Usage Introduction"
---
I've been on a slow transition to Obsidian as my primary note-taking app for the last 2-3 months and finally got to a place where it feels smooth enough to document how I've started using it.

I'm still super early in my learning of git, markdown, and Obsidian but it has been a huge improvement to my note-taking and once you get the systems in place, it makes the actual recording of a note much smoother and quicker.

### What I used in the past

For most classwork and previous studies, I've defaulted to google docs. They were simple, transferred easily across machines from google drive, and pretty easy to get up and running.

I was able to get through my Sec+ using this method but looking back, there were a few shortcomings that Obsidian fulfills nicely.
1. It was hard to do much else in notes other than bullet points
    - Getting pictures or diagrams to work nicely with text-wrapping or even a table didn't do it for me. 
2. There wasn't an intuitive way to link topics together throughout notes.
    - If for example a SIEM concept or 802.1X came up in multiple chapters, it would've been nice to use/incorporate both of those notes and build out a more complete idea instead of two separate instances
3. Categorizing notes left much to be desired
    - I defaulted to a hierarchy of cert/textbook/chapter for organization in google drive. It worked to keep things nice and neat but that's about all it was good for. 

### How I use Obsidian currently

While I still keep certain notes corralled under chapter folders, I've limited those to only include:
1. Specific exam tips from the chapter
2. Chapter summaries or "You should know XYZ" excepts from the readings

Everything else relies on the tag and linking system that makes Obsidian what it is.
For example a few of my early notes from my CySA+ studies are:
1. Security Controls
    - Draws in from other notes through links to more comprehensive lists I've made of various types and examples (Preventative vs corrective vs compensating, etc)
2. CIA Triad
3. Threat, Vulnerability, Risk Relationship.

    - Both my obsidian vault and this blog are managed through github repos. I still keep my local repo in google drive for redundancy but all versioning and control is handled through git.
