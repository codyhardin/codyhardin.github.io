I've been on a slow transition to Obsidian as my primary note-taking app for the last 2-3 months and finally got to a place where it feels smooth enough to document how I've started using it.

I'm still super early in my learning of git, markdown, and Obsidian but it has been a huge improvement to my note-taking and once you get the systems in place, it makes the actual recording of a note much smoother and quicker.

### What I used in the past
---
For most classwork and previous studies, I've defaulted to google docs. They were simple and easy to edit and work on in a browser.

I was able to get through my Sec+ using this method but looking back, there were a few situations where it fell short.
1. It was hard to do much else in a google doc other than bullet points
    - Getting pictures or diagrams to work nicely with text-wrapping or even a table didn't do it for me. 
2. There wasn't an intuitive way to link topics together throughout notes.
    - If for example a SIEM concept or 802.1X came up in multiple chapters, it would've been nice to use/incorporate both of those notes and build out a more complete idea instead of two separate instances
3. Categorizing notes left much to be desired
    - I defaulted to a hierarchy of cert/textbook/chapter for organization in google drive. It worked to keep things nice and neat but that's about all it was good for. 

### How I use Obsidian currently
---
While I still keep certain notes corralled under chapter folders, I've limited those to only include:
1. Exam tips from the chapter
2. Chapter summaries or "You should know XYZ" excerpts from the readings

Everything else relies on the tag and linking system that makes Obsidian what it is.
For example a few of my early notes from my CySA+ studies are:
1. Security Controls
    - Links to/from other notes through to more comprehensive lists I've made of various types and examples (Preventative vs corrective vs compensating, etc)
2. CIA Triad
3. Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk.

    - Both my obsidian vault and this blog are github repos. I still keep my local repo in google drive for desktop as a failsafe but all versioning is handled through git and initial setup of the local repos was through github desktop.
